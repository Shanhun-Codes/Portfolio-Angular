    "Hi, I'm Travis Shanhun — a tech-focused leader and full-stack web developer with over two years of combined experience across personal projects, professional teaching, and real-world development.\nMy journey into tech started with a deep curiosity about how technology is reshaping the world, leading me to self-study through platforms like YouTube and Codecademy, and eventually graduating from the University of Kansas coding bootcamp with a focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).\nToday, I bring a strong background in both full-stack web development and curriculum design, having spent the past eight months professionally teaching the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) to new developers. I’m passionate about creating user-centric, responsive web applications and leveraging my 15+ years of customer service experience to foster collaboration, mentorship, and strategic growth in tech teams.\nCurrently, I'm expanding my skill set into full-stack Ruby on Rails development, driven by a commitment to continuous learning and the thrill of tackling complex technical challenges. I'm particularly passionate about backend engineering, application security, and helping others unlock their potential in technology.\nSome of my proudest achievements include immigrating to the U.S., earning my GED, becoming the first in my family to pursue higher education, and transitioning into tech leadership roles through dedication, resilience, and a love for innovation.\nI'm excited to keep pushing boundaries, build transformative web applications, and empower the next generation of tech professionals.",
